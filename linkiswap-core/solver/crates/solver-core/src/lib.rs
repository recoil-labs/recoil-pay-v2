//! Core solver engine for the OIF solver system.
//!
//! This module provides the main orchestration logic for the solver, coordinating
//! between all the various services (discovery, order processing, delivery, settlement)
//! to execute the complete order lifecycle. It includes the event-driven architecture
//! and modular design for building solver instances.
